Week-to-Filename Mapping for Provided Files:

Week 1 - Java-week-1.docx
Week 2 - Java-week-2.docx
Week 3 - Java-week-3.docx
Week 4 - Java week-4.docx
Week 5 - Java week-5.docx
Week 6 - JAVA-WEEK-6.docx
Week 7 - Java-week-7c.docx  (assumed Week 7)
Week 8 - JAVA-WEEK-8.docx
Week 9 - Java Week - 9.pdf
Week 10 - JAVA-WEEK-10.docx
Week 11 - JAVA-WEEK-11.docx
Week 12 - JAVA-WEEK-12.docx

Note:
- All files will be placed in the docs/ folder in the final website structure.
- Download links for each week will point to these respective filenames unless the user wants renamed files.
- Once content from all files is extracted, dynamic content display will be built accordingly.

Please confirm this mapping and approach before I proceed with website creation steps.
